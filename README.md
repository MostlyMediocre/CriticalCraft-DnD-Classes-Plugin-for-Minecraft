# CriticalCraft-DnD-Classes-Plugin-for-Minecraft
This is a plugin created for the minecraft server CriticalCraft:Making Exandria. The goal is to impliment all Dungeons And Dragons 5e classes balanced around a level 10 character into a Minecraft server plugin that would allow for both PvE and PvP.

This project is created for the community over at https://discord.com/KQUHrEd and the minecraft server/map they are creating. If you have any intersting joining the project or the community of critters head on over.
